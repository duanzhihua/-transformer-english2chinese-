When training these models in a distributed setting across multiple GPUs or machines (nodes), it's often beneficial to parallelize the embedding layer.  `ParallelEmbedding` is designed to distribute the vocabulary across different processes (ranks) in a distributed training setup. This means each process is responsible for storing and computing embeddings for only a portion of the entire vocabulary. This reduces memory footprint and computational load on each individual process.\n",

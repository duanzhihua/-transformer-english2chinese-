        "**Firecrawl** developed by the Mendable.ai team, is a data ingestion tool that streamlines web data extraction using web scraping, API access, and automated browser interactions. It‚Äôs ideal for collecting structured and unstructured data from websites for analytics.\n",

        "### **Features of Firecrawl**:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Crawl**: Collects content from all URLs within a web page, converting it into an LLM-ready format for seamless analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Scrape**: Extracts content from a single URL, delivering it in formats ready for LLMs, including markdown, structured data (via LLM Extract), screenshots, and HTML.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Map**: Inputs a website and retrieves all URLs associated with it at high speed, enabling a comprehensive and efficient site overview.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "All the above features make it ideal for collecting structured and unstructured data from websites for agentic workflows.\n",
